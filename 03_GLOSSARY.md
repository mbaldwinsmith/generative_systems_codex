# Living Glossary

**Alignment** - tuning of attention, desire, and life toward truth, love, and God.

**Assumptive Union Operator** ⊕ - healing union without confusion or domination; the way divine life fully assumes wounded human reality in order to heal it from within.

**Attractor** - a repeated, stabilised pattern of inner life and behaviour.

**Attractor basin / Attractor topology** - the "terrain" of habitual tendencies and stable patterns within a person or community; repair reshapes basin topology toward truthful love and relational coherence.

**Coherence** - healed, stable, cruciform love under pressure.

**Convergence operator** - an iterative transformation that gently aligns a person or community toward the Logos grammar, stabilising truthful love under pressure over time.

**Coupling / Recoupling** - relational linkage that allows truthful influence and communion; recoupling restores fractured connection without coercion or domination.

**Distortion gradient (∇A)** - a directional pull toward misalignment, reactivity, or collapse within the attractor landscape; nepsis gently dampens these gradients to protect clarity and safety.

**Entropy** - moral-relational fragmentation, drift, and loss of coherence.

**Field** - shared relational influence and formative atmosphere (not "cosmic stuff").

**Field resistance / Coherence conductivity** - relational "friction" or "flow" within communal life; agape reduces resistance and increases coherent participation without coercion.

**Forgiveness** - grace-governed release of retaliatory binding and relational debt that opens space for truth, justice, and healing without denial or coerced reconciliation.

**Gift-field** - the environment of unearned belonging and divine initiative that precedes effort and makes healing possible; the way grace is experienced as a sustaining field rather than a transaction.

**Lament** - truthful grief turned toward God that names loss and injustice without bypass, opening space for mercy, justice, and hope.

**G / L / P Layers (Ground, Logos, Presence)** - the layered structure of the human system:  
- **Ground (G)** - belonging, safety, and continuity of self  
- **Logos (L)** - meaning, conscience, narrative, and truth-making  
- **Presence (P)** - relational attunement and capacity for communion  

**Radiance** - overflow of healed coherence into others.

**Reference field / Convergence grammar** - a stable shared grammar that anchors communal truth and guards against drift (for example, Scripture as a public grammar of discernment).

**Relational entrainment** - a gentle synchronisation of attention and desire through shared prayerful presence, leading to aligned coherence without pressure or loss of agency.

**Repair ecology** - a habitat where healing becomes natural.

**Signal-to-noise ratio (σ)** - a qualitative measure of clarity versus distortion in attention, desire, and discernment; practices increase σ by reducing reactivity and noise, not by suppressing humanity.

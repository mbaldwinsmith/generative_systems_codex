# Monthly Attractor Discernment (Gardener Review)

## What this is
A gentle, trauma-aware monthly review that notices stabilizing and destabilizing attractor patterns in the life of the pilgrim. It protects syntropic formation and interrupts entropic drift by staying close to truthful love under pressure.

## What this is not
This is not a performance audit, behavior scorecard, or moral diagnosis. It does not optimize output or rank spiritual progress. It is a listening practice that keeps the heart safe and honest.

## When to use
Once a month is enough. If the month has been hard, shorten it. If this review creates pressure, stop and return to simple prayer and embodied care.

## Posture and setup
- Begin with 1-2 minutes of quiet. A simple breath prayer is enough.
- Hold the month as a single "seasonal field," not a timeline of tasks.
- Keep the body in view: sit comfortably, drink water, soften the shoulders.
- Ask for gentleness, not clarity at any cost.

## The practice

### Step 1 - Orientation
Say a simple prayer of consent, such as:
"Christ, meet me in truth and kindness. Let this be gentle."

### Step 2 - Notice syntropic attractors
Prompt:
"Which recurring patterns in the past month have become more natural, more peaceful, more stabilizing, and more life-giving?"

Guidance:
- Name patterns, not achievements.
- Limit to three.
- Keep them plain and concrete.

### Step 3 - Notice entropic attractors
Prompt:
"Which recurring patterns in the past month have increased pressure, fragmentation, agitation, shame, or depletion?"

Guidance:
- Treat these as coherence signals, not failures.
- Limit to three.
- Avoid explanation or self-judgment.

### Step 4 - Locate the wounded layer
For each entropic attractor, ask which layer felt most strained:
- Ground (safety, rest, embodied stability)
- Logos (truth, meaning, inner narrative)
- Presence (connection, trust, belonging)

Record only the primary layer for each item.

### Step 5 - Choose one gentle adjustment
Prompt:
"What is one small, compassionate, protective adjustment that would stabilize coherence next month?"

Requirements:
- Must reduce pressure
- Must increase embodied safety
- Must not require heroic effort
- Must protect life rather than optimize output

Choose one adjustment only.

## Recording format
- Syntropic Attractors (max 3)
- Entropic Attractors (max 3)
- Primary Wounded Layer(s)
- One Gentle Adjustment

## Example (fictional)
Syntropic Attractors:
- A short breath prayer on waking most days
- One steady walk in creation each week

Entropic Attractors:
- Late-night scrolling that shortens sleep
- Skipping lunch on stressful days

Primary Wounded Layer(s):
- Late-night scrolling -> Ground
- Skipping lunch -> Ground

One Gentle Adjustment:
- Set a 10-minute evening wind-down and place the phone on a charger outside the bedroom.

## Safeguards
- Do not moralize, diagnose, optimize, or pressure.
- If shame rises, pause and simplify to prayer and rest.
- If trauma symptoms intensify, seek support and reduce spiritual demands.

Close with a short blessing or a simple phrase of trust, and let the review be enough.
